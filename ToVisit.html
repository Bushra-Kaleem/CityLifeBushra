    <p>Kanpur, also known as Cawnpore, is a metropolitan city in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India. Founded in 1803, Kanpur became one of the most important commercial and military stations of British India. Nestled on the banks of Ganges River, Kanpur stands as the major financial and industrial centre of North India and also the ninth-largest urban economy in India. Today it is famous for its colonial architecture, gardens, parks and fine quality leather products which are exported mainly to the West.
	The city is famous for its leather and textile industries. It is the 12th most populous city and the 11th most populous urban agglomeration in India. Kanpur was an important British garrison town until 1947, when India gained independence. The urban district of Kanpur Nagar serves as the headquarters of the Kanpur Division, Kanpur Range and Kanpur Zone.
	With the first woolen mill of India, commonly known as the Lal Imli (literally meaning "Red Tamarind", for a brand produced by the mill) by the British India Corporation established here in 1876 by Alexander MacRobert. The eastern and northern facades of the mill are reminiscent of the Palace of Westminster, due to their architecture, proximity to the Ganges river and with the north-east corner of the mill being topped by a clock tower similar to Big Ben in London. This similarity underscores the city's importance and prestige during the British times, which extends till date; making the Lal Imli — a great highlight of the city. The city is also widely regarded as the "Leather City of the World" and is predominantly nicknamed as the "Manchester of the East", for its textile industries.<p>

  	<p>In 1876 five residents of Cawnpore, namely, Mr. George Allen (afterwards Sir George Allen), Mr. W.E. Cooper (afterward Sir William Earnshaw Cooper), Mr. Bewan Petman, Dr. Condon, and Mr. Gavin S. Jones erected a small mill for the manufacture, chiefly, of Army Blankets. The original plant appears to have consisted of Cards and Mules, followed by Handlooms in the weaving, and a power driven Finishing Plant.<br>
  	This company, which was know as "The Woolen Mills Cawnpore", continued somewhat precautious until 1882, when advantage was taken of the New Indian Companies Act to convert it into public company with limited liability. The name of the new company was "The Cawnpore Woolen Mills and Army Cloth Manufacturing Co., Ltd.,"-a name which it continued to hold until 1914, when opportunity of a chance in the capital structure of the company was taken to alter the name to "The Cawnpore Woolen Mills Co., Ltd.".</p>
